<h4><span class="fw-bold">Legends: Arceus Proofing:</span></h4>

Due to the complexity of the Effort Level system, only full 31 IVs are counted towards the IV proof barrier.<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Overworld & Outbreak Encounters:</span></h6>
 <u>You must provide:</u>
  <ul>
    <li>A consistent video of a successful capture, leading into in-box Effort Level evaluation and summary screens, enough to clearly show OT/TID and nature of the Pokémon.</li>
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Your Pokémon must be sent to the party. Ensure you have a slot available for it to go to.</span> This is due to the compexity of the box system.</li>
    <li>If your Pokémon was achieved by RNG abuse, you should include screenshots of tools used to further prove IVs. You may also use overlays such as capturesight accompanied with a proof video to prove the IVs.</li>
    <li>Disable autosave to re-encounter most Pokémon in the overworld. Use this to your advantage and save upon encountering any Pokémon you believe may need proof, and you can then adjust your party accordingly.</li>
  </ul>

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Scripted, Gift & Legendary Encounters:</span></h6>
  <u>You must provide:</u>
  <ul>
    <li>A consistent video of a successful capture or redemption leading into in-box Effort Level evaluation and summary screens, enough to clearly show OT/TID and nature of the Pokémon.</li>
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Your Pokémon must be sent to the party. Ensure you have a slot available for it to go to.</span> This is due to the compexity of the box system.</li>
    <li>Some scripted/legendary encounters have an involved cut-scene, in the event of this you may start your video recording from any point during the cut-scene.</li>
    <li>Tips, tricks and advice for proofing scripted/legendary encounters can be found in the example directly below.</li>
