    <td><span class="fw-bold">Apricot Balls</span></td>
    <td>Specific Poké Ball types originally obtained from Apricorns in HGSS. They returned in later games, but became limited in quantities through natural gameplay. In Sword & Shield You can get more by beating the Champion's Cup or the Isle of
      Armor’s Cram-O-Matic. Examples include: Moon Ball, Fast Ball, and Friend Ball. Along with Apriballs, there are four more types of "Rare" Poké Balls: Dream Ball, Beast Ball, Sport Ball, and Safari Ball, which similarly reappeared later games, but
      became limited in quantity.</td>
