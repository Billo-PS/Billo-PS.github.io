  <tr>
    <td><span class="fw-bold">Illegal</span></td>
    <td>A Pokemon that is impossible to achieve by a player in game, meaning cheat codes or third party edits were used to achieve a result. Illegal Pokemon are banned from trading in the Wi-Fi room.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="fw-bold">Hacked</span></td>
    <td>A Pokemon that was achieved by cheating in any way, shape or form, this includes hacked legal Pokemon. Hacked Pokemon are banned from trading in the Wi-Fi room.</td>
