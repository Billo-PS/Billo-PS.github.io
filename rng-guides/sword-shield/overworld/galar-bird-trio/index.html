<hr />

If you made it this far, it must mean you have an interest in RNG abusing Galarian Articuno, Zapdos, & Moltres! This page will cover the whole process, from finding a desirable location to achieving a final result.<br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Getting Started:</span></h3>
<u>Before starting, do the following:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Meet the in-game requirement to have the birds roaming in each of the Wild Areas.</li>
  <li>Unlock a fly point in each of the areas. Snowslide Slope (Articuno) Meet-Up Spot (Zapdos) and Mustard's Dojo (Moltres) are recommended.</li>
  <li>Press the Home button on your controller, click <code>Connect</code> on the main window of the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Time to get to work!</span></h3>
The goal is to fly into the location of our desired bird on the calculated target frame given by the generator. The advancement methods used are listed on the main page of this guide, <u>day skip</u>, <u>menuing</u> and <u>fly</u> advances will be used for this example.<br /><br />

If you plan to use the <code>DaySkip</code> feature you should take note of how many frames advance per day skipped to make sure you don't overshoot your target.<br /><br />

We will be aiming for any marked Zapdos for this example. You can be more specific with the filters if you wish, such as filtering for a specific mark or specific IVs.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">The process for RNG abusing each of the birds is the same.</span> You will simply fly to the correct location depending on which of the birds you are hunting.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 1 -</span> Tool setup<br />

<span class="fw-bold">Awesome, everything looks good!</span> Time to find an ideal position to stand in-game and set the weather condition.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 2 -</span> Game setup<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-2.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br />

<u>These three fly points are suggested as they're close to the spawn point of each of the birds, meaning we can encounter them more quickly.</u><br /><br />

Once the main window is filled in correctly & you are stood in a good position in-game, you can begin looking for target frames by clicking the search button on the generator.<br /><br />

<u>If your results are not desirable, repeat the following:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect your Switch from the tool.</li>
  <li>Restart your game and enter the overworld.</li>
  <li>Enter the pause or Home menu and reconnect your Switch to the tool.</li>
  <li>Search again, do this until you have desirable results.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">We found one!</span> A marked Zapdos-Galar in a cluster on advances x-y. These are the target frames for this example and we'll be flying to our desired location on any of these frames.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure  3 -</span> Target found!<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-3.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

It's common to see clusters of shiny frames when searching for a target, a cluster is a group of target frames that all end with the same result. It's a good idea to aim for large clusters of shiny frames when you put this guide into practice. The more duplicates in the cluster the more chances we will have at hitting our target Pokémon.<br /><br />

Advance the RNG state while watching the <code>Curr adv.</code> box, head towards the spawn point of the Pokémon when you see your target number on-screen.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We hit our target frame!</span> If you believe you flew into position on the correct frame, run towards the it and initiate the encounter, once you are in-battle use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the generator to confirm the Pokémon you are in battle with matches the output of the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 5/6/7 -</span> Result Found!<br />

The Zapdos matches the output of the tool, mission accomplished! Espeon in party slot 1 with the ability Syncronize was used to determine the nature, using a Pokémon with this ability will make the nature of any overworld Pokémon match the nature of yours.<br /><br />

Different areas & environments can have a drastic influence on delay, if you are missing targets when you believe you should be finding results, you should consider reading the Troubleshooting Encounters section down below.<br /><br />

<hr />

<div class="bg-secondary title">
  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Troubleshooting Encounters</h1>
</div>

<hr />

This section covers how to troubleshoot encounters and delays. If you keep missing targets, spawning in the wrong Pokémon, or can't find your result on the RNG tool, this is the place to be.<br /><br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Missing Targets:</span></h3>
<u>The commonly occuring reasons for missing a target Pokémon are:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Encounter spawned too late due to mistiming.</li>
  <li>There is a delay left unaccounted for.</li>
  <li>Information in the main window was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Encounter did not spawn or spawned too late...</span></h5>

This is a common issue players will face when tackling this hunt as the delay is variable and not always consistent. Simply retry and search for a new target frame and make sure your player positioning is correct.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Troubleshooting delay...</span></h5>

Each galarian bird has a different delay which need calculating independently. Your delay is calculated by <code>frame hit - Frame initated = delay</code>. We can use the <code>Read Encounter</code> feature of the tool to confirm the frame we are hitting and see if we need to account for any delay. Here's how it's done!
<ul>
  <li>Aim for a target, such as any marked bird.</li>
  <li>Take a practice attempt and fly into the target. Take note of the frame you the Pokémon was spawned on.</li>
  <li>Encounter the Pokémon and click the <code>Read Encounter</code> button if you didn't find the Pokémon what you expected.</li>
  <li>Do a filterless search and find the frame you hit, take note of the number and subtract the target frame number from it.</li>
  <li>This will be your delay for that particular encounter.</li>
</ul>

<u>When RNG abusing in unstable conditions like these you should record delays for multiple attempts before aiming for a target and check for any consistent delay counts. It is also advised to aim for large clusters where possible to increase your chances of actually hitting the target.</u><br /><br />

Once you have noted down a few delays aim for targets once again, this time factoring in the delay you noted down. For example if we hit a delay of 100, our final A press will be 100 frames before the result you can see on the generator.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 8 -</span> Delay troubleshooting example<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-8-troubleshooting-encounters.png" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

We encountered an Zapdos, but it wasn't the one we desired! So what happened here? Well... We miscalculated. Let's try to find the frame we actually hit.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Figure 9 -</span> Finding the frame<br />
<img src="./images/galar-bird-trio/figure-9-locating-frame.gif" style="width:675px;height:400px;"><br /><br />

By doing a filterless search we can see our Zapdos. The frame we hit was 2 frames behind where we wanted to be, oh well! We will adjust accordingly for next time by walking into the grass 2 frames later.<br /><br />

<h5><span class="fw-bold">Cannot find result...</span></h5>
If you cannot find the Pokémon you are in battle with anywhere on the tool this is likely due to one of two reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Losing track of advancements.</li>
  <li>The information entered into the main window of the tool was not completely accurate.</li>
</ul>

Double check the information on the main tab is entered correctly by searching it on the Encounter Lookup and clicking the correct row. <u>You must pay attention to the row you are clicking and making sure it matches your in-game environment.</u><br /><br />

That's all there is to it!<br /><br />
